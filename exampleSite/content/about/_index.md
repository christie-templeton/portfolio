My name is Christie Templeton.

## Technical Writing

I started my career as a Technical Writer long before I actually held the job title. I was the one everyone in the office consulted when they couldn't understand how to use an application, as I always dove in to learn it myself and then sent them instructions they could easily reference to get their job done. This eventually evolved into me landing my official first role as a Technical Writer when I was employed at Unisys. There I assisted their many clients, including TSA, DHS, and Amgen, with gathering processes and requirements and then drafting procedural documentation that was provided for customers, agents, engineers, and other audience types.
