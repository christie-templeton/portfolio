# AV Stickers & Tags Project

The business needed to deter employees and guests from tampering with the AV equipment in the meeting rooms. I was brought in to design a series of stickers and hang-tags to help meet their goal of redirecting users to AV support.

## Mock-ups

This set of images is from an AV sticker and tag placement project I assisted with for Manatt. The images were designed in Adobe Illustrator per the specifications of the Director who wanted to deter employees from tampering with devices in the meeting rooms. Each tag was designed with a custom fit to the Polycom equipment.

## Final Prints:

The designs were sent to a printer who provided our designs on both stickers as well as hard plastic hang-tags.
